This repository was written in 2019. It uses electronic medical record (EMR) data from an emergency department (ED) in a large U.S hospital to determine how cultural stereotypes and institutional constraints influence patterns of pain treatment. Specifically, it examines how pain treatment via opioid analgesices is influenced by the intersection of ED crowding and race, the time patients visit the ED, patients’ medical histories, patients’ diagnoses, age, sex, marital status, and year of analysis. Results generally support past findings on these topics, but does so with larger data. Most interestingly, the results show a negative relationship between ED crowding and opioid prescribing.
